simple-PHP-accounts
===================

simple user accounts system using PHP/mySQL
I have dumbed the system down to 4 simple function calls, all listed in sample.php
Code is documented in doxygen/javadoc style

This is intended to work under any environment. If you are using a framework, copy config.php into user.php to resolve inclusion issues.

1. Have a PHP/mySQL setup ready
2. Edit config.php to your likings
3. run command "php create_tables" to create database with tables
4. Take a look at sample.php for directions
